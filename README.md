# Spotify and Spotipy 

Goals - to automate playlists, and also understand the kind of music that I listen to

1. Pull my spotify data, visualise and analyse them, compare them to mainstream music
2. Based on preferences, generate a new playlist (negate the need to manually create them on spotify, which can be cumbersome)
3. Some data science fun - PCA? t-SNE? predict if a music would be in my taste category?
